## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Navigate to (https://github.com/vigneriCodes/python-password-manager)
2. Clone or download 'python-password-manager'
3. Open a command prompt window, navigate to the directory where your Python script is located, and type "python" followed by the filename of your Python script (with the ".py" extension) and press 'Enter'.

   - for example; "python main.py" to run the script "main.py" in the current directory.

4. Enter the name of the website in the "Website:" entry field.
5. Adjust the email/username you would like to associate with the new password in the "Email/Username:" entry field. (_Optionally; change the email in line '132' of 'main.py' to be your chosen email for this to populate automatically with your preferred email._)
6. Press the 'Generate Password' button.
7. Press the 'Add'
8. A messagebox will appear asking if you are satisfied with the information entered/password generated. Click 'OK' if you are 'Cancel' if not satisfied.
9. A file called "data.json" will be generated on your machine with the information saved in the JSON format. _**Conversely if that file already exists; the file will be updated with the new information.**_
10. Repeat steps 4-9 to add more websites and passwords.
